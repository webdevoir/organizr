# README

This repo is a rails + react application, used for portfolio purposes. 
Although to do list portfolio apps are so cliche, I've been writing one to showcase my ability to learn new methods/technologies quickly. Because of my years of experience with other web technologies, it becomes a notable strength of mine as a developer to use what I already know to connect the dots, and think outside the box to find solutions to problems I've never encountered myself directly. This is why I feel I can move forward confidently in developing this application, which is what I wanted to demonstrate. 

Although my total years of experience professionally developing with Ruby on Rails is quite low (4 month coop at ThinkResearch), I had the opportunity to develop a distributed system and client application built with a very similar framework called Phoenix. If you havn't heard of Phoenix before, think of Rails written in Elixir (a programming language most people havn't heard of either). 

To summarize, my history developing in Phoenix gives me essentially 100% transferrable experience to developing in Rails, due to the vast similarities of the platforms. Because of this, I expect to adapt to the Rails environment very rapidly. 

Things I will need to fill in at some point:

* Ruby version
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
